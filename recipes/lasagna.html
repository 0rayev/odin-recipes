    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with various ingredients such as rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. The pasta sheets are typically boiled beforehand to make them tender, and then layered in a baking dish with the sauces and other fillings. The dish is then baked in the oven until the pasta is cooked through and the top layer becomes golden and crispy.

        The meat sauce, known as ragù in Italian, is often made with ground beef or pork, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs such as basil and oregano, creating a savory and flavorful base. The béchamel sauce, a creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, adds richness and a velvety texture to the dish. Additionally, ingredients like ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan are commonly used to add depth of flavor and richness to each layer.

        Lasagna is a versatile dish, and variations abound depending on regional and personal preferences. Some popular variations include vegetable lasagna, which replaces the meat sauce with layers of sautéed vegetables such as spinach, mushrooms, and zucchini, or seafood lasagna, which incorporates shrimp, crab, or lobster into the filling. Regardless of the variation, lasagna is beloved for its comforting and hearty qualities, making it a favorite for family gatherings and special occasions.
