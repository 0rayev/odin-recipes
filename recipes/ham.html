    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A honey glazed ham is a culinary masterpiece that tantalizes the senses with its combination of sweet and savory flavors. Starting with a premium cut of ham, often spiral-sliced for easy serving, this dish undergoes a transformation as it's coated in a luscious glaze composed of honey, brown sugar, and spices. The ham is meticulously scored to allow the glaze to seep into every crevice, ensuring each bite is infused with the perfect balance of sweetness and depth.</p>
    <p>As the honey glazed ham bakes in the oven, the glaze caramelizes, forming a glistening, golden-brown crust that envelops the tender, succulent meat. The aroma that fills the kitchen is irresistible, promising a culinary experience that is as delightful to the nose as it is to the palate. Once it's time to carve and serve, each slice reveals a mosaic of flavors, from the rich, smoky notes of the ham to the sticky sweetness of the glaze, making it a centerpiece worthy of any special occasion or holiday feast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ham: </strong>This recipe calls for one 5-pound ready-to-eat ham. If your ham is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloves: </strong>Aromatic whole cloves add warm, spicy-sweet flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey: </strong>Of course, you'll need honey. Pro-tip: Spray your measuring cup with cooking spray so the honey slides out easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Corn Syrup: </strong>Dark corn syrup adds more flavor and contributes to caramelization. Some reviewers suggest substituting brown sugar or using a combination of corn syrup and brown sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Butter adds and helps retain moisture, resulting in a juicy honey-baked ham that's impossible to resist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan. </li>
        <li>In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham. </li>
        <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. </li>
        <li>Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
